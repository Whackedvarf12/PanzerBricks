                As you know the germans are coming to attack us through the Baltic.
                We have set up defences best as we can, but we still have secret weapons.
                One you will command is KV2, stronk tonk with stronk gun.
                You will get 1 driver, 1 radio operator, 1 gunner and 2 loaders.
                Your task is to troll the BLYAT out of CYKA panzer divisions.
                Use arrow left and right to move tonk.
                You have one round of special vodka bounce APCR, use well.
                Every time panzer goes to gulag new weaker one appears in place.
                Mark VI to III to II and no more, hit each possition 3 times.
                If you can, hit from sides for lot of damage.
                Survivability for battle is none, but you are not ment to survive, you will sacrifice.
                Now go commander, drink whole bottle of potato juice and give your life for motherland.
                PS: stalinium armor tear fabric of time, so you might stop time for some time, don't move tonk and should fix.<br/>
